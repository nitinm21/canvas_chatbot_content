        1. Question:  
        Why do 'inactive' students show up under People in Canvas, and what does it mean?  </p>
        
        <br>  
        The "inactive" status in Canvas is typically used when a student drops a course or is temporarily removed from accessing the content by the Student Information System (SIS), such as Banner Information. Students are not deleted from a course to maintain the integrity of SIS data. However, you can filter out these inactive students in the gradebook by using the "Apply Filters" button located at the top left of the roster. If you have further questions, assistance is readily available. </br>

       <p>2. Question: How do I get access to create recordings in Panopto for my course assignments?</p> 
        <br>Answer: To access and create recordings in Panopto, follow these steps:
The primary access method is through Okta > Canvas > Courses > Panopto. While this generally provides viewing access to recorded lectures, creating recordings may require additional permissions.
If you encounter issues with creating recordings, here are the current options:
First verify you can access Panopto through the proper navigation path: Okta > Canvas > Courses > Panopto
If you can view recordings but cannot create them, you'll need to:
Contact your course instructor to confirm recording permissions should be enabled
Submit a support ticket with your course details and specific access needs
In cases where Panopto recording access is temporarily unavailable, the recommended workaround is to:
Record your video separately using other recording tools
Upload the video file directly to the course assignment section in Canvas
Note that if you experience persistent access issues, the support team will work with Panopto Support to resolve the underlying permissions problem while providing alternative submission methods to ensure you can complete your coursework requirements.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I ensure students do not see their quiz grades on Canvas until I finalize and release them, and what does the "Restrict student result view" checkbox mean?</p>3. Question:
        <br>Answer: To ensure students cannot see their quiz grades on Canvas until you decide to release them, follow these steps:
        Go to Grades on the left-side menu in your Canvas course.
        Locate the quiz column in the Gradebook.
        Click the three dots (options menu) at the top of the quiz column.
        Select Grade Posting Policy from the dropdown menu.
        Choose Manually for the posting policy. This setting ensures that grades remain hidden from students until you manually post them.
        Verify that there is a crossed-out eye icon next to the quiz column in the Gradebook, which indicates that grades are hidden from students.
        After grading and finalizing the quiz, you can manually release the grades by selecting Post Grades from the same three-dot menu when you're ready.
        Regarding the "Restrict student result view" checkbox in the quiz settings:
        This setting allows you to control what students can see after submitting a quiz. If you uncheck all options under this setting, it will hide all result details (e.g., correct answers, incorrect answers, and overall scores) and only show a submission confirmation message to students.
        The checkbox can be misleading because it does not entirely prevent students from seeing their grades if the Grade Posting Policy is set to automatic. The Grade Posting Policy must also be set to manual to fully restrict grade visibility until you choose to release them.

        <p> Question: Why am I unable to access Panopto to record and upload a video for my assignment, and how can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are unable to access Panopto to record and upload a video for your assignment, here are the steps and resolutions provided:
        Initial Troubleshooting Steps:
        Ensure you are navigating correctly: Go to Okta → Canvas → Courses → Panopto → '+ Create' (button).
        If this does not resolve the issue, confirm whether the problem lies specifically with recording videos through Panopto.
        Resolution Process:
        The issue has been acknowledged, and the support team is working with Canvas and Panopto Support to identify and resolve the problem as soon as possible.
        Teaching Assistants (TAs) have been informed that they might need to request instructors to extend assignment due dates if the issue persists.
        Alternative Solution:
        You can ask your instructor to allow media recordings to be uploaded directly within the assignment as a temporary workaround until the Panopto issue is resolved.
        Support Follow-Up:
        If you have further questions or concerns, you are encouraged to reach out for additional assistance.</br>

        <p> Question: I am unable to log in to Panopto from Canvas, which is preventing me from submitting video assignments. I have tried using different browsers and accounts, but the issue persists. How can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are unable to log in to Panopto via Canvas and are receiving an "access denied" error, follow these steps for resolution:
        Ensure you are navigating correctly through Okta → Canvas → Courses → Panopto Video → '+ Create' button. If this process still results in an error, confirm if the issue persists by providing a screenshot for further diagnosis.
        While the issue is being worked on with Panopto Support, you can ask your instructor for an alternative submission method. Specifically, request permission to record your video separately and upload it as a "File" directly in the assignment submission area. This is a temporary workaround until the login issue is resolved.
        The support team will continue coordinating with Panopto Support to address the root cause of the problem. You will be notified once a permanent solution is implemented.</br>

        <p> Question: Why are Canvas pages, such as the grade book and assignments page, loading slowly after uploading course materials, and how can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The slow loading of Canvas pages is a known issue when numerous graded links are created for resources in the platform. This occurs because Canvas struggles to efficiently handle a large number of links, especially when many of them are set as graded items. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to avoid creating graded links for every single resource. Instead, you can follow these steps:
        Use section header links to guide students to the appropriate chapter or module.
        Only add graded links for essential items like Labs and Quizzes that require grade synchronization with Canvas.
        Avoid grading supplementary materials such as videos, fact sheets, or demonstrations unless necessary. If these are graded, they typically default to a simple pass/fail system.
        This approach reduces the load on Canvas and improves page performance.
        Additionally, the publisher has been contacted to provide a tutorial on how to implement this method effectively. Updates will be shared once the tutorial is available. </br>

        <p> Question: Why is the student I added to my course in Canvas not showing up under the grades folder, and is there a "student" role in Canvas or can one be created?</p>
        <br>Answer: The reason the student is not appearing under the grades folder is that they are not yet registered in Banner, which is why they were not automatically added to your course as a student. To resolve this issue, you need to contact the Office of the Registrar at registrar@iit.edu to finalize the student's registration. Once the registration is complete, the student will appear in your course with the correct role.
        In Canvas, there is indeed a "student" role, but it is assigned automatically when students are registered through Banner. If you manually assign a role such as "dual enrollment inst.," it may not provide full functionality, such as appearing in the grades folder</br>

        <p> Question: Why am I unable to access the materials in one of my Canvas courses, even though I am enrolled and can see the announcements?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are unable to access course materials in Canvas but can see announcements, it is likely that the materials are located in the "Modules" section of the course. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
        Navigate to the left-side menu in your Canvas course.
        Click on "Modules."
        All class slides and content should be uploaded there.</br>
        ---

        <p> Question: How can I download quiz responses in Canvas and compare responses from all students to a single question?</p>

These statistics include data that might help analyze quiz performance. You can follow the guides below for more details on accessing these reports:

        Navigate to the "Navigation" tab at the top.
        Drag the "Assignments" option from the lower box and drop it into the upper box.
        Scroll down and click "Save."</br>

        <p> Question: Is it possible to restore content to Blackboard courses I taught in previous years? If so, how can this be done, and what steps are involved? Additionally, I am still unable to see the restored content. What could be the issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: Yes, it is possible to restore content to Blackboard courses taught in previous years. The process involves the following steps:
        Initial Request:
        A request is sent to the IT Helpdesk specifying the courses and terms for which restoration is needed. For example, courses like ECE 438 (Spring 2022), ECE 436/437 (Fall 2017, Fall 2018, Fall 2020) were requested for restoration.
        Processing the Request:
        The IT team forwards the restoration request to the appropriate storage manager (e.g., Amazon storage manager) to retrieve the archived course files. Once retrieved, the files are loaded back into Blackboard, and the requester is added as a "Teacher" in those courses.
        Completion Notification:
        Once restored, a confirmation email is sent to notify that the process is complete. For instance, courses such as RESTORE_ECE_438.202220 and RESTORE_ECE_436_437.201810 were restored successfully.
        Follow-Up Issues:
        If the restored content is not visible:
        Ensure that the correct email address is being used for access.
        Verify that permissions have been correctly assigned.
        Communicate with the IT team for further clarification or escalation if necessary.
        Resolution of Issues:
        If issues persist, IT may follow up with storage managers or recheck permissions. For example, in this case, a follow-up was conducted when the requester reported not seeing the content.</br>

        <p> Question: Why is my registered course not visible on Canvas, even though I have paid tuition and started the course? </p>
        <br>Answer: The course is not yet published by your instructor. To resolve this issue, please kindly ask your instructor to click the "Publish" button in Canvas. Once the instructor publishes the course, it will become visible to students.</br>
        ---

        <p> Question: When I open my Canvas page and select a class to view, why am I not given options such as syllabus, modules, assignments, etc., and instead only see the professor's class picture and bio?</p>
        <br>Answer: This issue typically occurs when the course navigation settings in Canvas are not configured to display certain sections (e.g., syllabus, modules, assignments). It is possible that the instructor has hidden these sections from the course menu or they have not yet been published.
        To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
        Confirm with your professor whether the course content has been made available to students.
        If the content should be visible but isn't, take a screenshot of what you see and share it with your institution's IT support or Learning Management System (LMS) team for further assistance.

        <p> Question: How can I hide the Assignment % column on the Grades page in Canvas so that it is not visible to all students, and ensure it is hidden globally for both the instructor and the TA?</p>
        <br>Answer: The Assignment % column in Canvas can only be seen by instructors and TAs when it is hidden. Students do not have access to a hidden column unless it is explicitly made visible by the instructor or TA. To ensure that the column is hidden globally:
        Both the instructor and TA should verify that the column is marked as hidden in their respective views.
        Use the "Student View" feature in Canvas to confirm what students can see. This tool allows you to preview the course from a student's perspective and ensure that the column is not visible to them.</br>

        <p> Question: Why does a Panopto video lecture not play properly, even though other videos in the same course and other courses work fine? How can I resolve this issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue of a Panopto video lecture not playing properly, while other videos work fine, may occur due to browser settings or device-specific problems. Here are the steps you can take to resolve the issue:
        Clear Browser Cache and Cookies: Clear all cache and cookies from your browser as stored data might interfere with video playback.
        Update Your Browser: Ensure that your browser is updated to the latest version. Google Chrome is the preferred browser for Panopto.
        Try a Different Device: Test the video on another device to check if the issue persists.
        Use Alternative Browsers: If the problem continues, try using other browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.

        <p> Question: Why is a regular student being assigned teacher permissions in UCertify when accessing an eBook through a deep link in Canvas, and how was this issue resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue involved a regular student being incorrectly assigned as a "teacher" in UCertify whenever they accessed an eBook through a deep link in Canvas. This resulted in the student gaining access to grades and other sensitive information in the UCertify backend. Despite attempts to delete the student from the UCertify system, they were reassigned as a teacher upon clicking the deep link again.
        To address this issue:
        The problem was reported to UCertify's technical team for investigation. Communication with Akbar Kamal from UCertify confirmed that their team was working on resolving the issue.
        A meeting was suggested by UCertify to discuss the matter further, but it was clarified that the student was unaware of the issue and had not been contacted yet.
        After collaboration between Illinois Tech's IT team and UCertify's technical team, the issue was resolved during a call with Akbar and his team.
        The resolution was confirmed by UCertify support, and it was communicated that if the problem reappeared, another call could be scheduled for further troubleshooting.</br>

        <p> Question:  A student who did not enroll in CS116 has access to the course on Canvas. How can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If a student who is not enrolled in a course has access to it on Canvas, follow these steps to resolve the issue:
        Verify the student's enrollment status in the course through the Student Information System (SIS) or other institutional systems.

        <p> Question: How can I coordinate to take a remote exam for an online section when I face issues with communication and setup?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are facing challenges coordinating a remote exam for an online section, follow these steps based on the scenario provided:
        Initial Steps to Coordinate:
        Reach out to your instructor or the designated office (e.g., "IIT Online") to confirm the exam format and proctoring details.
        If you receive incorrect contact information or face delays, escalate the issue by contacting support services like the Center for Learning Innovation (CLI) or similar departments.
        When No Response is Received:
        If you do not hear back from the office or department, try alternative methods of contact such as visiting their office in person or sending follow-up emails.
        If the office is inaccessible, notify support staff about your situation and request immediate assistance due to time constraints.
        Support Staff Assistance:
        Support staff may attempt to assist by contacting your instructor directly to explain your situation. If they cannot reach the instructor immediately, they may leave a message requesting further action.
        They might also provide alternative solutions, such as links to proctoring tools like "Monitor EDU," which you should test as soon as possible.
        Communicating with Support:
        Clearly explain your challenges, such as lack of information about how the exam will be administered or who is responsible for proctoring it.
        Provide details about your efforts, such as emails sent, offices visited, or time spent trying to resolve the issue.
        Final Steps Before the Exam:
        If the exam is imminent and no resolution has been reached, confirm whether support staff have access to your exam materials and can administer it.
        Request immediate clarification from your professor if they believe no further action is needed on their part.
        Reassurance and Follow-Up:
        Support staff will likely reassure you that alternative arrangements can be made if there are issues with proctoring. They may also encourage you to reach out with any additional questions or concerns.</br>

        <p> Question: Why was the "New Quizzes" interface missing from my Canvas course, and how was the issue resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The requestor reported that the "New Quizzes" interface in Canvas was missing from their course, specifically noting that the "Build" button was not visible in the quiz creation module.

        <p> Question: Why was I unable to submit or edit grades for an exam in Canvas, and how can I manually add grade columns for paper exams in the gradebook?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue with submitting or editing grades occurred because the "Assign to" section in the Quiz settings was set to only two students. This caused Canvas to create a separate grade submission for those two students, deleting the grades for everyone else. The issue was resolved by resetting the "Assign to" section to "Everyone," which restored all grades in the Gradebook.
        For manually adding grade columns to the gradebook, such as for paper exams, follow these steps:
        Navigate to the "Assignments" section in Canvas and create a new assignment.
        Set the assignment type as either "No Submission" or "On Paper."
        Assign an appropriate point value and due date to the assignment.
        Publish the assignment. Once published, it will generate a column in the gradebook where you can manually enter scores.</br>

        <p> Question: Why am I not receiving emails sent to the class email address, and how can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are not receiving emails sent to the class email address, here are the steps to resolve the issue:
        Verify Email Sending Method: Confirm how your professor sends emails to the class. If they are using a group email address (e.g., fall2024-236001@kentlaw.iit.edu), ensure that you are added to that group. This issue may arise if your email address is not included in the group distribution list.
        Canvas Notifications Settings: While this issue is unrelated to Canvas notifications, it is still recommended to verify your Canvas settings:
        Go to your Canvas dashboard.
        Click on "Account" in the left-side menu.
        Select "Notifications".
        Ensure that a green bell icon appears under your email address for "Content" and "Files" as well as other sections from which you'd like to receive notifications. If not, click on the bell icon and select "Notify Immediately".
        Request Addition to Class Group: If you are certain that the issue is with the class email group, contact your professor or the relevant administrator and request to be added to the group email list for all your classes. Provide specific details about the classes where you are experiencing this issue.
        Follow Up with IT Support: If adjusting Canvas settings and requesting group addition do not resolve the issue, notify IT support or your institution's learning innovation center. Provide them with examples of missed emails and confirm whether your email is correctly configured in their system.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I ensure that students cannot see their quiz grades in Canvas until I am ready to release them? </p>
        <br>Answer: To ensure that students cannot see their quiz grades until you're ready to release them, you need to adjust the Grade Posting Policy and restrict the student result view in the quiz settings. Here's what you can do:
        Go to Grades on the left-side menu in Canvas.
        Find the quiz column in the Gradebook.
        Click the three dots (options menu) at the top of the quiz column.
        Select Grade Posting Policy.
        Choose Manually. This will ensure that grades remain hidden from students until you manually post them.
        Once you've set the manual posting policy, make sure there’s a crossed-out eye icon next to the quiz column in the Gradebook. This indicates that grades are hidden from students.
        Additionally, in the quiz settings, there is a checkbox labeled "Restrict Student Result View." This allows you to limit or completely hide quiz results from students after submission, depending on your selection. If you uncheck everything under this setting, it restricts all access to results except for the submission confirmation.
        After grading and finalizing the quiz, you can manually release the grades by selecting Post Grades.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I resolve the issue of uploading QTi files with test questions into new Canvas item banks when the process fails and returns an error?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you encounter an issue while uploading QTi files with test questions into new Canvas item banks, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:
        Verify File Format and Content: Ensure that the QTi file is properly formatted and contains valid test questions. Double-check that the file adheres to Canvas's supported formats for item bank uploads.
        Review Error Message: Carefully examine the error message provided during the upload failure. This can give specific clues about what might be causing the issue (e.g., unsupported question types, file corruption, or naming conflicts).
        Test with a Sample File: Create a smaller sample QTi file with a few test questions to see if it uploads successfully. This helps isolate whether the issue is with the specific file or the overall upload process.
        Follow Canvas Instructions: Revisit the instructions for uploading QTi files into item banks. Ensure that you are following each step correctly, including dragging and dropping files or using the upload button.
        Contact Support: If the issue persists, reach out to your institution’s LMS administrator or support specialist. Provide them with:
        A detailed description of the problem.
        The error message you received.
        A sample of the problematic QTi file (if possible) for testing purposes.
        Reopen Support Ticket if Needed: If you had previously canceled a support ticket, but the issue remains unresolved, reopen it or create a new one to get assistance from your LMS team.</br>

        <p> Question: I am unable to watch a video recorded on Zoom. When I try to play the recording via Panopto, I am asked to sign in, but I get a message saying "user is not assigned to this application." Additionally, when I try to access the recording via Zoom, it says the recording does not exist. How can I resolve this issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: This issue appears to be related to authentication and access permissions. Here's how it was resolved in this case:
        The problem was identified as an authentication issue with Panopto and Zoom. The user was unable to access the video recording due to being unassigned to the application and receiving an error stating that the recording does not exist in Zoom.
        To resolve the issue, the support team uploaded the recording directly to the user's Sandbox in Panopto. The recording was made available under "Panopto Video" in the left-side menu of their Sandbox.
        The user was advised that the video would be ready in approximately 30 minutes and instructed on where to find it.
        If you encounter a similar issue:
        Check if you have proper access permissions for both Panopto and Zoom.
        If authentication issues persist, contact your IT support team and request manual intervention, such as uploading the video directly to an accessible location.
        Provide screenshots or detailed descriptions of the errors for quicker resolution.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I resolve the issue of sending batch emails in Outlook, which currently verifies each individual email before sending and has a 5-second timeout, making the process inefficient and unusable for sending emails to students?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue you are experiencing with Outlook's batch email functionality can be addressed by utilizing the "Inbox" feature in Canvas. This feature operates like an email platform and allows you to send messages to all your students, either in one class or across multiple classes. Additionally, it provides the option to receive a copy of your own message in your email inbox for record-keeping.
        Here are the steps to resolve your issue:
        Use the "Inbox" feature in Canvas to send batch emails to students.
        Refer to the following tutorials for guidance:

        <p> Question: How can I retrieve a document submitted as a class assignment in Fall 2021 through Blackboard for an Independent Seminar course, and what steps are involved?</p>
        <br>Answer: To retrieve a document submitted as a class assignment in Fall 2021 through Blackboard, follow these steps:
        Provide Course Details: Share the course name and number along with the name of the submission. This information is necessary to locate the archived course.
        Contact the Instructor: Since the course and its content are considered the instructor's property, you need to contact your instructor to request permission for retrieval. Without their consent, no manipulation or download of course materials can be performed.
        Forward Permission: Once you have obtained permission from your instructor, forward their approval to the helpdesk so they can proceed with retrieving the document.</br>

        <p> Question: Why was I unable to log into Canvas, and why did I receive an email stating that my assignment was uploaded but not submitted?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue you experienced with Canvas could be caused by several factors. Here’s a detailed explanation and steps to address it:
        Assignment Submission Issue:
        Canvas sometimes sends notifications about assignments being uploaded but not submitted if the submission process is interrupted or incomplete. This can happen due to connectivity issues or session timeouts. Since you mentioned that you submitted the assignment around 8 PM but received an email stating it was only uploaded, it is possible that the final "Submit" action did not register.
        Login Problems:
        If you are unable to log into Canvas, it could be due to browser-related issues, such as cached data or cookies causing conflicts. Clearing your browsing cookies and cache, as you already mentioned doing, is a good step. Additionally, ensure that your internet connection remains stable during login attempts.
        Previous Quiz Logout Issue:
        The sudden logout during your quiz could indicate a session timeout or a network interruption. Canvas may log users out if there is inactivity or if the system detects a security issue.
        Steps to Resolve:
        Ensure your internet connection is stable and secure.
        Use an updated version of a supported browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
        Clear your browser cache and cookies again before trying to log in.
        If the issue persists, try accessing Canvas from a different device or network to rule out local device/network problems.
        Contact your professor directly regarding the assignment submission issue and provide evidence (e.g., screenshots) showing that you attempted to submit it on time.</br>

        <p> Question: Is there a way to prevent the TA role in Canvas from accessing Item Banks and Quizzes, or do I need to remove the TA from the course entirely?</p>
        <br>Answer: Yes, you can prevent the TA role from accessing Item Banks and Quizzes in Canvas by temporarily changing their role to "Student" while preparing your Quiz. Here’s how you can do it:
        Open your course in Canvas.
        Go to "People" on the left-side menu.
        Search for the TA in the list.
        Click on the three dots next to their name on the right side.
        Select "Edit Role" from the dropdown menu.
        Change their role to "Student."
        Once you have finished preparing your Quiz, you can follow the same steps to change their role back to "TA."</br>

        <p> Question: Why couldn't I load the DEI modules in Canvas, and how was the issue resolved? </p>
        <br>Answer: The issue occurred because of a technical problem with the course. Initially, I reported that I couldn't load the DEI modules in Canvas despite being able to log in and having a working internet connection. The modules would remain stuck loading.
        After reporting the issue, I was asked to provide a screenshot of the problem and confirm my Illinois Tech email address for further investigation. Upon review, it was determined that there was a technical issue with the course, which was then resolved. However, when I tried accessing the modules again, the problem persisted.
        Eventually, I discovered that switching from Firefox to Chrome resolved the issue. Chrome is more compatible with certain features of Canvas, which allowed me to successfully access the DEI modules. If similar issues arise, using Chrome is recommended for better compatibility.</br>

        <p> Question: Why did recurring Zoom meetings disappear from Canvas, and how can this issue be prevented in the future?</p>
        <br>Answer: The disappearance of recurring Zoom meetings from Canvas may occur if the connection between Canvas and Zoom becomes unsynchronized. This can happen due to interruptions in the integration between the two platforms or updates in either system. Although merging course sections in Canvas is known to delete scheduled Zoom sessions, this issue can also arise even when only one course section is involved. Specifically, if the meetings were properly scheduled using the built-in Zoom tool within Canvas and linked to your official institutional email address, a sync issue between the Canvas Zoom LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) and your Zoom account could be the cause.
        To prevent this from happening again:
        Ensure that all recurring Zoom meetings are scheduled through the built-in Zoom tool in Canvas using your official email address.
        Regularly verify that the integration between Canvas and Zoom is functioning correctly, especially after any platform updates.
        If similar issues arise, report them immediately to your institution's IT support or open a ticket with Canvas Support for further investigation.</br>

        <p> Question: I am trying to upload my assignment for the subject Data Warehousing, where I was asked to submit a CSV file. However, I am unable to do so because it is showing errors. What should I do?</p>
        <br>Answer: It seems like your instructor has put a file upload restriction on this assignment. Please kindly ask the instructor to remove the restriction so that you can submit any file type, including CSV. If you have further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to reach out.</br>

        <p> Question: Why was a total grade incorrectly showing in the Canvas Gradebook for an assignment group that had not yet been graded? How was this issue resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue occurred because some of the "Daily Reflections" assignments were incorrectly counting toward the "Out of Class Reflections" assignment group in the Canvas Gradebook. This caused grades to appear in the column for the "Out of Class Reflections" even though no grades had been entered, as these reflections were supposed to represent 14% of the total grade (7% each) and should have shown 0% until graded.
        The problem was resolved when the "Daily Reflections" assignments were moved out of the "Out of Class Reflections" group. After this adjustment, the grades displayed correctly in the Gradebook. The requester confirmed that this resolved the issue and clarified that it was not related to having only one assignment in the group but rather due to incorrect assignment grouping.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I ensure that a Zoom meeting recording uploaded to Panopto is deleted and prevent future meetings from being automatically recorded and uploaded?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you have scheduled the meeting using the built-in Zoom feature on the left-side menu of a specific Canvas course and the "Record meetings automatically" option is checked, the meeting will be recorded automatically, and the recording will become available in that course's Panopto folder shortly after the meeting ends.
        To avoid this in the future:
        Use the Zoom desktop application to schedule your meetings instead of scheduling through Canvas.
        Ensure that the "Record meetings automatically" option is not checked when scheduling the meeting.
        Look for a field called "panopto_folder_context" when scheduling your Zoom meeting via the desktop app. This field contains a 4-digit number indicating the Panopto folder where recordings are stored. Erase any number in this field to prevent a folder connection between your Zoom meeting and Panopto.
        Regarding ensuring that a specific recording has been deleted:
        If you believe the recording has been deleted but want confirmation, provide the link to the Panopto folder or forward any related email notifications from Panopto to your IT support team so they can verify its deletion.
        If you no longer have access to confirm deletion, contact IT support with any available details about the recording (e.g., date, time, or associated folder) for further assistance.</br>

        <p> Question: Why was my active Canvas course overwritten when I attempted to set up a new course, and how can I resolve the issues with accessing the course and ensuring the grades are correct?</p>
        <br>Answer: When setting up a new course in Canvas for Spring 2025, it appears that the new template overwrote your active Fall 2024 course (INTM 410). This resulted in your inability to access the active course and discrepancies in the grade roll-up, although individual grades remain accurate. To resolve this issue:
        The ticket was reviewed by the Center for Learning Innovation, and steps were taken to address the problem. The issue is being handled through email communication to ensure your course is restored.
        You are advised to coordinate with the assigned support personnel to schedule a follow-up meeting. This meeting will focus on cleaning up duplicate items and ensuring everything is set up correctly.
        If you encounter further issues or need additional assistance, continue communicating with the support team via email.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I download a video from Canvas for offline viewing if internet access will be limited?</p>
        <br>Answer: If the video is hosted on Panopto and you are permitted to download it, you should locate a download icon on the upper right side of the screen while playing the video. If the download option is not available, you will need to contact your instructor to request permission. If the instructor approves, they can share the downloadable file with you.

        <p> Question: How can I export item-level quiz results from Canvas for a course I am teaching?</p>
        <br>Answer: Unfortunately, Canvas does not currently provide a direct way to export item-level quiz results. Here is the information and workaround based on the available features:
        Using Quiz Statistics:
        Canvas allows you to view Quiz Statistics, which provides item-level analytics for quizzes. However, this data cannot be exported directly in a detailed format.
        Reports for New Quizzes:
        If you are using Canvas New Quizzes, you can use the Reports feature. This allows you to download analytics for a specific quiz as a CSV file, which might include some relevant details.
        Exporting Gradebook Data:
        You can export quiz results from the Gradebook in Canvas by following these steps:
        Navigate to the Grades section in your Canvas course.
        Click on the Export button in the top-right corner of the page and select CSV.
        Open the downloaded CSV file in Excel or any spreadsheet program. This file will include overall scores for all assignments, quizzes, and other graded items but not item-level data.
        Submitting Feature Requests:
        Canvas has a New Ideas Page where you can submit feature requests. If item-level quiz result export is critical for your teaching needs, consider submitting this idea so developers can prioritize it for future updates.</br>

        <p> Question: Why were my Canvas homework submissions not being received by the TA, and how was the issue resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue occurred because the TA for the course was only enrolled in Section 1 of the course, while you were enrolled in Section 2. As a result, the TA could not access your submissions or see your name in the roster. To resolve this issue, your instructor needed to add the TA to Section 2 of the course. The steps to do this were as follows:
        Go to the "People" section in Canvas.
        Locate the TA's name and click on the three dots on the right-hand side of their name.
        Select "Edit Sections."
        Choose Section 2 of the course from the drop-down menu.
        Click "Update."
        Once these steps were completed, the TA gained access to your submissions and could grade your work.</br>

        <p> Question: I accidentally deleted everyone's exam scores in Canvas except for one student's score when I allowed them to take the exam after the due date. Is there a way to recover the lost grades?</p>
        <br>Answer: To address this issue, you can use the "Gradebook History" feature in Canvas, which might contain a record of your previous gradings. Follow these steps:
        Go to your course in Canvas.
        Navigate to "Grades."
        Click on the "Gradebook" dropdown located at the top left of the screen.
        Select "Gradebook History" from the dropdown menu.
        This will provide an overview of the previous grades and may help you recover the lost data.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I easily access student comments or feedback on assignments in Canvas without clicking through each assignment individually?</p>
        <br>Answer: Unfortunately, Canvas does not currently provide a centralized view for all assignment comments in one place. However, instructors can use the Inbox feature located in the left-side menu of Canvas to track comments. By filtering messages for a specific course, it becomes easier to view recent comments without navigating through each assignment individually.
        Since this is a common need, many instructors submit feature requests to Canvas for a centralized comment view. You might consider visiting the Canvas Ideas page to vote for existing requests or submit your own suggestion. These requests are reviewed by the developers and could be included in future updates.</br>

        <p> Question: I am getting an error 400 when uploading class videos under "Modules" in Canvas, which indicates I am exceeding the storage limit. Is there another way to upload these files?</p>
        <br>Answer: Each Canvas course has a storage limit of up to 1000 MB. If you are trying to upload large files such as videos, you can use Panopto instead, as it provides almost unlimited storage. "Panopto Video" is accessible via the left-side menu of your course in Canvas.
        Additionally, your course quota has been increased to 1500 MB to provide some extra space.</br>

        <p> Question: Why am I not receiving emails for Canvas announcements, and how can I fix this issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are not receiving emails for Canvas announcements, it could be due to your notification settings in Canvas. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
        Log in to your Canvas account.
        Navigate to the course where you are experiencing the issue.
        On the left-hand side menu, click on 'Account.'
        Select 'Notifications' from the dropdown menu.
        Ensure that all relevant notifications, particularly for announcements, are set to "Notify immediately."
        By adjusting these settings, you should start receiving emails for Canvas announcements.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I retrieve the email addresses of students in my class when they are no longer available on the Class List in the Faculty Dashboard, and what alternatives are there for contacting students?</p>
        <br>Answer: To retrieve the email addresses of students in your class, you can use the following methods:
        Finding Login IDs in Canvas:
        Open your course in Canvas.
        Navigate to the 'People' section on the left-side menu. Here, you can find the students' Login IDs.
        If you need to see all student Login IDs in the grade roster:
        Go to 'Grades' on the left-side menu.
        Click on the three dots next to the "Student Name" column.
        Select "Secondary info" and then click on "Login ID."
        The Login IDs will appear under each student's name in the "Student Name" column.
        Forming Email Addresses:
        For students in the College of Computing, their email addresses follow this format: LoginID@hawk.iit.edu. For example, if a student's Login ID is "abcd," their email address will be abcd@hawk.iit.edu.
        Using Canvas Inbox:
        Canvas provides an "Inbox" tool that allows you to send messages to your students. Though this tool functions like email, it is integrated within Canvas and may not offer the same user experience as external email clients.
        If you prefer using your own email client and dislike Canvas Inbox, note that direct access to student email addresses via the Class List has been discontinued since Spring 2024. This change may be due to policy updates or system modifications.</br>

        <p> Question: I am unable to upload video documents to Canvas, and I cannot see my earlier submissions. How can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue seems to be related to the assignment settings in Canvas. Specifically, the "Media Recordings" submission type box is not checked by your instructor. This option is required to enable video submissions.
        To resolve this issue, please contact your instructor and request them to check the "Media Recordings" box in the Assignment settings. Once this setting is updated, you should be able to upload video documents successfully.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I determine the creation date of a file uploaded to Canvas, and is it possible to verify if the creation date differs from the submission date?</p>
        <br>Answer: To determine the creation date of a file uploaded to Canvas and verify if it differs from the submission date, you can use specific API calls provided by Canvas Support. The API call retrieves detailed metadata about the file, including its creation date, submission date, and other relevant details. Below are the steps and relevant information based on an example scenario:
        API Call Details:
        For a file labeled with Assignment ID 11361, the API response indicates:
        File was created on: October 17, 2024, at 16:38:51 UTC (2024-10-17T16:38:51Z).
        File was submitted on: November 7, 2024.
        This confirms that the creation date is earlier than the submission date.
        Additional File Information:
        For another assignment file labeled with Assignment ID 14105, similar API calls can be used to retrieve its creation and submission dates. Canvas Support may assist in running these API calls if needed.
        Process to Retrieve Data:
        If you are unsure how to execute these API calls, you can request assistance from Canvas Support by opening a ticket.
        Ensure you provide assignment IDs or direct links to the files in question for accurate results.
        Accessing Submission Details:
        Basic submission details (e.g., submission time) are available in the upper right corner of the SpeedGrader interface for each assignment link in Canvas.
        However, file creation dates are not directly visible in Canvas and require API access.</br>

        <p> Question: Why are two of my published Fall 2024 courses in Canvas not appearing on the dashboard, even though they are published and accessible under "All Courses"? How can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue seems to be related to a system glitch in Canvas. Here's the resolution process that was followed:
        Upon investigation, it was confirmed that all your Fall 2024 courses (ECE 218, ECE 311, and ECE 485/585) are published and accessible through the "All Courses" menu on the left side of the Canvas interface. You can navigate there to view and open these courses.
        However, the courses ECE 311 and ECE 485/585 were not appearing on the dashboard. This is likely due to a technical issue in Canvas.
        The support team has escalated this matter to Canvas Support to identify and resolve the root cause of the problem. They have acknowledged receiving similar reports from other users.
        In the meantime, you can continue accessing your courses via the "All Courses" menu.</br>
        ---

        <p> Question: Why did my Fall 2024 courses disappear from my Canvas dashboard, and how can I ensure they reappear?</p>
        <br>Answer: Canvas displays a maximum of 20 active courses on the dashboard by default. When new courses, such as Spring 2025 courses, are added to your account, they may push older courses off the dashboard if the total exceeds this limit. To ensure specific courses, like your Fall 2024 courses, reappear on your dashboard, you need to "favorite" (star) them. Favoriting a course will prioritize it for display on your dashboard.
        Here are the steps to favorite a course:
        Log in to Canvas.
        Navigate to the "Courses" section in the global navigation menu.
        Click on "All Courses."
        Locate the courses you want to appear on your dashboard and click the star icon next to them to favorite them.
        Once you favorite the desired courses, they will appear on your dashboard even if the total number of active courses exceeds 20.</br>

        <p> Question: What steps should I take to investigate and address the issue where students claim their quiz answers were altered after submission in Canvas?</p>
        <br>Answer: To investigate and address the issue where students claim their quiz answers were altered after submission in Canvas, follow these steps:</br>
        Verify Quiz Settings:
        Confirm whether the "Shuffle Questions" option was enabled before the exam started.
        Check if the "Let Students See Their Correct Answers" option was disabled, as this may impact what students see post-exam.
        Ensure that "Shuffle Answers" was disabled to rule out alignment issues.
        Review Logs:
        Access the quiz logs for the affected students by navigating to the "Moderate" tab in Canvas, searching for the specific student, and clicking "View Log."
        Look for timestamps where discrepancies occurred (e.g., elapsed times mentioned in logs). This can help identify if students revisited questions or changed answers.
        Collect Evidence from Students:
        Request detailed examples from students about which questions they believe were altered. Screenshots or descriptions of the discrepancies can be helpful.
        Review any screenshots or communications provided by students to identify patterns or recurring issues.
        Consult Canvas Support:
        Open a ticket with Canvas Support and provide them with all relevant details, including course name, exam title, affected students' information (excluding PII), and a description of the issue.
        Include any evidence collected from logs or student reports to assist their investigation.
        Communicate Findings:
        If Canvas Support confirms that no changes occurred post-submission, communicate this back to the students while sharing log evidence to clarify any misunderstandings.
        If an issue is identified (e.g., a bug), work with Canvas Support to resolve it and inform affected students of corrective actions.
        Preventative Measures:
        Avoid making changes to quiz settings (e.g., randomization) after students have started taking the exam, as this can cause alignment issues.
        Double-check quiz settings before publishing exams to ensure they align with intended configurations.</br>

        <p> Question: I am unable to open the link provided in the email regarding the exam schedule. I’ve tried accessing it through different browsers and devices, but the link remains inaccessible. How can I resolve this issue? </p>
        <br>Answer: If you are unable to access the exam schedule link provided in an email, please follow these steps to resolve the issue:
        Ensure that you are connected to the IIT-Secure network rather than EDUroam, as this might affect access to certain resources.
        If you are experiencing a username or password error while trying to log in, visit the Support Desk at DTC in room 540 for a manual password reset or resynchronization.
        If the issue persists, provide additional details such as the course or assignment name related to the exam schedule and copy-paste the email containing the problematic link. This information will help IT staff investigate further.</br>
