        1. Question:  
        Why do 'inactive' students show up under People in Canvas, and what does it mean?  </p>
        
        <br>  
        The "inactive" status in Canvas is typically used when a student drops a course or is temporarily removed from accessing the content by the Student Information System (SIS), such as Banner Information. Students are not deleted from a course to maintain the integrity of SIS data. However, you can filter out these inactive students in the gradebook by using the "Apply Filters" button located at the top left of the roster. If you have further questions, assistance is readily available. </br>

       <p>2. Question: How do I get access to create recordings in Panopto for my course assignments?</p> 
        <br>Answer: To access and create recordings in Panopto, follow these steps:
The primary access method is through Okta > Canvas > Courses > Panopto. While this generally provides viewing access to recorded lectures, creating recordings may require additional permissions.
If you encounter issues with creating recordings, here are the current options:
First verify you can access Panopto through the proper navigation path: Okta > Canvas > Courses > Panopto
If you can view recordings but cannot create them, you'll need to:
Contact your course instructor to confirm recording permissions should be enabled
Submit a support ticket with your course details and specific access needs
In cases where Panopto recording access is temporarily unavailable, the recommended workaround is to:
Record your video separately using other recording tools
Upload the video file directly to the course assignment section in Canvas
Note that if you experience persistent access issues, the support team will work with Panopto Support to resolve the underlying permissions problem while providing alternative submission methods to ensure you can complete your coursework requirements.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I ensure students do not see their quiz grades on Canvas until I finalize and release them, and what does the "Restrict student result view" checkbox mean?</p>3. Question:
        <br>Answer: To ensure students cannot see their quiz grades on Canvas until you decide to release them, follow these steps:
        Go to Grades on the left-side menu in your Canvas course.
        Locate the quiz column in the Gradebook.
        Click the three dots (options menu) at the top of the quiz column.
        Select Grade Posting Policy from the dropdown menu.
        Choose Manually for the posting policy. This setting ensures that grades remain hidden from students until you manually post them.
        Verify that there is a crossed-out eye icon next to the quiz column in the Gradebook, which indicates that grades are hidden from students.
        After grading and finalizing the quiz, you can manually release the grades by selecting Post Grades from the same three-dot menu when you're ready.
        Regarding the "Restrict student result view" checkbox in the quiz settings:
        This setting allows you to control what students can see after submitting a quiz. If you uncheck all options under this setting, it will hide all result details (e.g., correct answers, incorrect answers, and overall scores) and only show a submission confirmation message to students.
        The checkbox can be misleading because it does not entirely prevent students from seeing their grades if the Grade Posting Policy is set to automatic. The Grade Posting Policy must also be set to manual to fully restrict grade visibility until you choose to release them.

        <p> Question: Why am I unable to access Panopto to record and upload a video for my assignment, and how can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are unable to access Panopto to record and upload a video for your assignment, here are the steps and resolutions provided:
        Initial Troubleshooting Steps:
        Ensure you are navigating correctly: Go to Okta → Canvas → Courses → Panopto → '+ Create' (button).
        If this does not resolve the issue, confirm whether the problem lies specifically with recording videos through Panopto.
        Resolution Process:
        The issue has been acknowledged, and the support team is working with Canvas and Panopto Support to identify and resolve the problem as soon as possible.
        Teaching Assistants (TAs) have been informed that they might need to request instructors to extend assignment due dates if the issue persists.
        Alternative Solution:
        You can ask your instructor to allow media recordings to be uploaded directly within the assignment as a temporary workaround until the Panopto issue is resolved.
        Support Follow-Up:
        If you have further questions or concerns, you are encouraged to reach out for additional assistance.</br>

        <p> Question: I am unable to log in to Panopto from Canvas, which is preventing me from submitting video assignments. I have tried using different browsers and accounts, but the issue persists. How can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are unable to log in to Panopto via Canvas and are receiving an "access denied" error, follow these steps for resolution:
        Ensure you are navigating correctly through Okta → Canvas → Courses → Panopto Video → '+ Create' button. If this process still results in an error, confirm if the issue persists by providing a screenshot for further diagnosis.
        While the issue is being worked on with Panopto Support, you can ask your instructor for an alternative submission method. Specifically, request permission to record your video separately and upload it as a "File" directly in the assignment submission area. This is a temporary workaround until the login issue is resolved.
        The support team will continue coordinating with Panopto Support to address the root cause of the problem. You will be notified once a permanent solution is implemented.</br>

        <p> Question: Why are Canvas pages, such as the grade book and assignments page, loading slowly after uploading course materials, and how can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The slow loading of Canvas pages is a known issue when numerous graded links are created for resources in the platform. This occurs because Canvas struggles to efficiently handle a large number of links, especially when many of them are set as graded items. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to avoid creating graded links for every single resource. Instead, you can follow these steps:
        Use section header links to guide students to the appropriate chapter or module.
        Only add graded links for essential items like Labs and Quizzes that require grade synchronization with Canvas.
        Avoid grading supplementary materials such as videos, fact sheets, or demonstrations unless necessary. If these are graded, they typically default to a simple pass/fail system.
        This approach reduces the load on Canvas and improves page performance.
        Additionally, the publisher has been contacted to provide a tutorial on how to implement this method effectively. Updates will be shared once the tutorial is available. </br>

        <p> Question: Why is the student I added to my course in Canvas not showing up under the grades folder, and is there a "student" role in Canvas or can one be created?</p>
        <br>Answer: The reason the student is not appearing under the grades folder is that they are not yet registered in Banner, which is why they were not automatically added to your course as a student. To resolve this issue, you need to contact the Office of the Registrar at registrar@iit.edu to finalize the student's registration. Once the registration is complete, the student will appear in your course with the correct role.
        In Canvas, there is indeed a "student" role, but it is assigned automatically when students are registered through Banner. If you manually assign a role such as "dual enrollment inst.," it may not provide full functionality, such as appearing in the grades folder</br>

        <p> Question: Why am I unable to access the materials in one of my Canvas courses, even though I am enrolled and can see the announcements?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are unable to access course materials in Canvas but can see announcements, it is likely that the materials are located in the "Modules" section of the course. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
        Navigate to the left-side menu in your Canvas course.
        Click on "Modules."
        All class slides and content should be uploaded there.</br>
        ---

        <p> Question: How can I download quiz responses in Canvas and compare responses from all students to a single question?</p>

These statistics include data that might help analyze quiz performance. You can follow the guides below for more details on accessing these reports:

        Navigate to the "Navigation" tab at the top.
        Drag the "Assignments" option from the lower box and drop it into the upper box.
        Scroll down and click "Save."</br>

        <p> Question: Is it possible to restore content to Blackboard courses I taught in previous years? If so, how can this be done, and what steps are involved? Additionally, I am still unable to see the restored content. What could be the issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: Yes, it is possible to restore content to Blackboard courses taught in previous years. The process involves the following steps:
        Initial Request:
        A request is sent to the IT Helpdesk specifying the courses and terms for which restoration is needed. For example, courses like ECE 438 (Spring 2022), ECE 436/437 (Fall 2017, Fall 2018, Fall 2020) were requested for restoration.
        Processing the Request:
        The IT team forwards the restoration request to the appropriate storage manager (e.g., Amazon storage manager) to retrieve the archived course files. Once retrieved, the files are loaded back into Blackboard, and the requester is added as a "Teacher" in those courses.
        Completion Notification:
        Once restored, a confirmation email is sent to notify that the process is complete. For instance, courses such as RESTORE_ECE_438.202220 and RESTORE_ECE_436_437.201810 were restored successfully.
        Follow-Up Issues:
        If the restored content is not visible:
        Ensure that the correct email address is being used for access.
        Verify that permissions have been correctly assigned.
        Communicate with the IT team for further clarification or escalation if necessary.
        Resolution of Issues:
        If issues persist, IT may follow up with storage managers or recheck permissions. For example, in this case, a follow-up was conducted when the requester reported not seeing the content.</br>

        <p> Question: Why is my registered course not visible on Canvas, even though I have paid tuition and started the course? </p>
        <br>Answer: The course is not yet published by your instructor. To resolve this issue, please kindly ask your instructor to click the "Publish" button in Canvas. Once the instructor publishes the course, it will become visible to students.</br>
        ---

        <p> Question: When I open my Canvas page and select a class to view, why am I not given options such as syllabus, modules, assignments, etc., and instead only see the professor's class picture and bio?</p>
        <br>Answer: This issue typically occurs when the course navigation settings in Canvas are not configured to display certain sections (e.g., syllabus, modules, assignments). It is possible that the instructor has hidden these sections from the course menu or they have not yet been published.
        To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
        Confirm with your professor whether the course content has been made available to students.
        If the content should be visible but isn't, take a screenshot of what you see and share it with your institution's IT support or Learning Management System (LMS) team for further assistance.

        <p> Question: How can I hide the Assignment % column on the Grades page in Canvas so that it is not visible to all students, and ensure it is hidden globally for both the instructor and the TA?</p>
        <br>Answer: The Assignment % column in Canvas can only be seen by instructors and TAs when it is hidden. Students do not have access to a hidden column unless it is explicitly made visible by the instructor or TA. To ensure that the column is hidden globally:
        Both the instructor and TA should verify that the column is marked as hidden in their respective views.
        Use the "Student View" feature in Canvas to confirm what students can see. This tool allows you to preview the course from a student's perspective and ensure that the column is not visible to them.</br>

        <p> Question: Why does a Panopto video lecture not play properly, even though other videos in the same course and other courses work fine? How can I resolve this issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue of a Panopto video lecture not playing properly, while other videos work fine, may occur due to browser settings or device-specific problems. Here are the steps you can take to resolve the issue:
        Clear Browser Cache and Cookies: Clear all cache and cookies from your browser as stored data might interfere with video playback.
        Update Your Browser: Ensure that your browser is updated to the latest version. Google Chrome is the preferred browser for Panopto.
        Try a Different Device: Test the video on another device to check if the issue persists.
        Use Alternative Browsers: If the problem continues, try using other browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.

        <p> Question: Why is a regular student being assigned teacher permissions in UCertify when accessing an eBook through a deep link in Canvas, and how was this issue resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue involved a regular student being incorrectly assigned as a "teacher" in UCertify whenever they accessed an eBook through a deep link in Canvas. This resulted in the student gaining access to grades and other sensitive information in the UCertify backend. Despite attempts to delete the student from the UCertify system, they were reassigned as a teacher upon clicking the deep link again.
        To address this issue:
        The problem was reported to UCertify's technical team for investigation. Communication with Akbar Kamal from UCertify confirmed that their team was working on resolving the issue.
        A meeting was suggested by UCertify to discuss the matter further, but it was clarified that the student was unaware of the issue and had not been contacted yet.
        After collaboration between Illinois Tech's IT team and UCertify's technical team, the issue was resolved during a call with Akbar and his team.
        The resolution was confirmed by UCertify support, and it was communicated that if the problem reappeared, another call could be scheduled for further troubleshooting.</br>

        Form Submission: Complete the Canvas Admin Access Agreement form. In the form, indicate "Departmental Admin" as the admin type.
        Submission Process: Email the completed form to SupportDesk@iit.edu for processing.

        <p> Question:  A student who did not enroll in CS116 has access to the course on Canvas. How can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If a student who is not enrolled in a course has access to it on Canvas, follow these steps to resolve the issue:
        Verify the student's enrollment status in the course through the Student Information System (SIS) or other institutional systems.
        If the student is confirmed not to be enrolled, request assistance from your institution's support desk or learning management system (LMS) administration team to remove the student's access.
        In this specific case, the issue was resolved as follows:
        The instructor contacted the support desk and requested that the student be removed from the CS116-01 Canvas course.
        The support team confirmed that the student no longer had access to the course and informed the instructor of the resolution.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I coordinate to take a remote exam for an online section when I face issues with communication and setup?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are facing challenges coordinating a remote exam for an online section, follow these steps based on the scenario provided:
        Initial Steps to Coordinate:
        Reach out to your instructor or the designated office (e.g., "IIT Online") to confirm the exam format and proctoring details.
        If you receive incorrect contact information or face delays, escalate the issue by contacting support services like the Center for Learning Innovation (CLI) or similar departments.
        When No Response is Received:
        If you do not hear back from the office or department, try alternative methods of contact such as visiting their office in person or sending follow-up emails.
        If the office is inaccessible, notify support staff about your situation and request immediate assistance due to time constraints.
        Support Staff Assistance:
        Support staff may attempt to assist by contacting your instructor directly to explain your situation. If they cannot reach the instructor immediately, they may leave a message requesting further action.
        They might also provide alternative solutions, such as links to proctoring tools like "Monitor EDU," which you should test as soon as possible.
        Communicating with Support:
        Clearly explain your challenges, such as lack of information about how the exam will be administered or who is responsible for proctoring it.
        Provide details about your efforts, such as emails sent, offices visited, or time spent trying to resolve the issue.
        Final Steps Before the Exam:
        If the exam is imminent and no resolution has been reached, confirm whether support staff have access to your exam materials and can administer it.
        Request immediate clarification from your professor if they believe no further action is needed on their part.
        Reassurance and Follow-Up:
        Support staff will likely reassure you that alternative arrangements can be made if there are issues with proctoring. They may also encourage you to reach out with any additional questions or concerns.</br>

        <p> Question: Why was the "New Quizzes" interface missing from my Canvas course, and how was the issue resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: The requestor reported that the "New Quizzes" interface in Canvas was missing from their course, specifically noting that the "Build" button was not visible in the quiz creation module. However, before the IT team could investigate further, the requestor canceled the ticket, stating they had identified the issue and resolved it on their own. </br>

        <p> Question: Why was I unable to submit or edit grades for an exam in Canvas, and how can I manually add grade columns for paper exams in the gradebook?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue with submitting or editing grades occurred because the "Assign to" section in the Quiz settings was set to only two students. This caused Canvas to create a separate grade submission for those two students, deleting the grades for everyone else. The issue was resolved by resetting the "Assign to" section to "Everyone," which restored all grades in the Gradebook.
        For manually adding grade columns to the gradebook, such as for paper exams, follow these steps:
        Navigate to the "Assignments" section in Canvas and create a new assignment.
        Set the assignment type as either "No Submission" or "On Paper."
        Assign an appropriate point value and due date to the assignment.
        Publish the assignment. Once published, it will generate a column in the gradebook where you can manually enter scores.</br>

        <p> Question: I am unable to access the Canvas website despite using the correct login credentials. Additionally, I have forgotten the password for the Cisco VPN. How can I resolve these issues?</p>
        <br>Answer: To address the issue with accessing the Canvas website, please follow these steps:
        Go to portal.iit.edu and log in using your IIT credentials.
        Once logged in, navigate to the "Tools" section located on the left-side menu.

        If you encounter any errors during this process, please take a screenshot of the error message and share it with the support team for further assistance.
        For your Cisco VPN password issue:

        If you need additional guidance on connecting to the VPN, please visit the IT support website for detailed instructions.

        <p> Question: I am unable to submit homework through Canvas. Every time I upload my homework, it shows an error. I am using the correct file format for submission. How can I resolve this issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: Please follow these steps to resolve the issue:
        Clear Browser Cache and Cookies: Clear all cache and cookies in your browser and try uploading the file again.
        Use a Different Browser: Switch to another browser to see if the issue persists.
        Try Another Device: If possible, use a different device to determine if the issue is related to your current machine.
        If none of the above steps resolve the problem, it is possible that your instructor has set a file upload restriction on the assignment that is interfering with your submission. In this case, please contact your instructor directly for further assistance.</br>

        <p> Question: Why am I not receiving emails sent to the class email address, and how can this issue be resolved?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you are not receiving emails sent to the class email address, here are the steps to resolve the issue:
        Verify Email Sending Method: Confirm how your professor sends emails to the class. If they are using a group email address (e.g., fall2024-236001@kentlaw.iit.edu), ensure that you are added to that group. This issue may arise if your email address is not included in the group distribution list.
        Canvas Notifications Settings: While this issue is unrelated to Canvas notifications, it is still recommended to verify your Canvas settings:
        Go to your Canvas dashboard.
        Click on "Account" in the left-side menu.
        Select "Notifications".
        Ensure that a green bell icon appears under your email address for "Content" and "Files" as well as other sections from which you'd like to receive notifications. If not, click on the bell icon and select "Notify Immediately".
        Request Addition to Class Group: If you are certain that the issue is with the class email group, contact your professor or the relevant administrator and request to be added to the group email list for all your classes. Provide specific details about the classes where you are experiencing this issue.
        Follow Up with IT Support: If adjusting Canvas settings and requesting group addition do not resolve the issue, notify IT support or your institution's learning innovation center. Provide them with examples of missed emails and confirm whether your email is correctly configured in their system.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I ensure that students cannot see their quiz grades in Canvas until I am ready to release them? </p>
        <br>Answer: To ensure that students cannot see their quiz grades until you're ready to release them, you need to adjust the Grade Posting Policy and restrict the student result view in the quiz settings. Here's what you can do:
        Go to Grades on the left-side menu in Canvas.
        Find the quiz column in the Gradebook.
        Click the three dots (options menu) at the top of the quiz column.
        Select Grade Posting Policy.
        Choose Manually. This will ensure that grades remain hidden from students until you manually post them.
        Once you've set the manual posting policy, make sure there’s a crossed-out eye icon next to the quiz column in the Gradebook. This indicates that grades are hidden from students.
        Additionally, in the quiz settings, there is a checkbox labeled "Restrict Student Result View." This allows you to limit or completely hide quiz results from students after submission, depending on your selection. If you uncheck everything under this setting, it restricts all access to results except for the submission confirmation.
        After grading and finalizing the quiz, you can manually release the grades by selecting Post Grades.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I resolve the issue of uploading QTi files with test questions into new Canvas item banks when the process fails and returns an error?</p>
        <br>Answer: If you encounter an issue while uploading QTi files with test questions into new Canvas item banks, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:
        Verify File Format and Content: Ensure that the QTi file is properly formatted and contains valid test questions. Double-check that the file adheres to Canvas's supported formats for item bank uploads.
        Review Error Message: Carefully examine the error message provided during the upload failure. This can give specific clues about what might be causing the issue (e.g., unsupported question types, file corruption, or naming conflicts).
        Test with a Sample File: Create a smaller sample QTi file with a few test questions to see if it uploads successfully. This helps isolate whether the issue is with the specific file or the overall upload process.
        Follow Canvas Instructions: Revisit the instructions for uploading QTi files into item banks. Ensure that you are following each step correctly, including dragging and dropping files or using the upload button.
        Contact Support: If the issue persists, reach out to your institution’s LMS administrator or support specialist. Provide them with:
        A detailed description of the problem.
        The error message you received.
        A sample of the problematic QTi file (if possible) for testing purposes.
        Reopen Support Ticket if Needed: If you had previously canceled a support ticket, but the issue remains unresolved, reopen it or create a new one to get assistance from your LMS team.</br>

        <p> Question: I am unable to watch a video recorded on Zoom. When I try to play the recording via Panopto, I am asked to sign in, but I get a message saying "user is not assigned to this application." Additionally, when I try to access the recording via Zoom, it says the recording does not exist. How can I resolve this issue?</p>
        <br>Answer: This issue appears to be related to authentication and access permissions. Here's how it was resolved in this case:
        The problem was identified as an authentication issue with Panopto and Zoom. The user was unable to access the video recording due to being unassigned to the application and receiving an error stating that the recording does not exist in Zoom.
        To resolve the issue, the support team uploaded the recording directly to the user's Sandbox in Panopto. The recording was made available under "Panopto Video" in the left-side menu of their Sandbox.
        The user was advised that the video would be ready in approximately 30 minutes and instructed on where to find it.
        If you encounter a similar issue:
        Check if you have proper access permissions for both Panopto and Zoom.
        If authentication issues persist, contact your IT support team and request manual intervention, such as uploading the video directly to an accessible location.
        Provide screenshots or detailed descriptions of the errors for quicker resolution.</br>

        <p> Question: How can I resolve the issue of sending batch emails in Outlook, which currently verifies each individual email before sending and has a 5-second timeout, making the process inefficient and unusable for sending emails to students?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue you are experiencing with Outlook's batch email functionality can be addressed by utilizing the "Inbox" feature in Canvas. This feature operates like an email platform and allows you to send messages to all your students, either in one class or across multiple classes. Additionally, it provides the option to receive a copy of your own message in your email inbox for record-keeping.
        Here are the steps to resolve your issue:
        Use the "Inbox" feature in Canvas to send batch emails to students.
        Refer to the following tutorials for guidance:
        Canvas Inbox Overview
        CLI Instructions on How to Use Canvas Inbox</br>

        <p> Question: How can I retrieve a document submitted as a class assignment in Fall 2021 through Blackboard for an Independent Seminar course, and what steps are involved?</p>
        <br>Answer: To retrieve a document submitted as a class assignment in Fall 2021 through Blackboard, follow these steps:
        Provide Course Details: Share the course name and number along with the name of the submission. This information is necessary to locate the archived course.
        Contact the Instructor: Since the course and its content are considered the instructor's property, you need to contact your instructor to request permission for retrieval. Without their consent, no manipulation or download of course materials can be performed.
        Forward Permission: Once you have obtained permission from your instructor, forward their approval to the helpdesk so they can proceed with retrieving the document.</br>

        <p> Question: Why was I unable to log into Canvas, and why did I receive an email stating that my assignment was uploaded but not submitted?</p>
        <br>Answer: The issue you experienced with Canvas could be caused by several factors. Here’s a detailed explanation and steps to address it:
        Assignment Submission Issue:
        Canvas sometimes sends notifications about assignments being uploaded but not submitted if the submission process is interrupted or incomplete. This can happen due to connectivity issues or session timeouts. Since you mentioned that you submitted the assignment around 8 PM but received an email stating it was only uploaded, it is possible that the final "Submit" action did not register.
        Login Problems:
        If you are unable to log into Canvas, it could be due to browser-related issues, such as cached data or cookies causing conflicts. Clearing your browsing cookies and cache, as you already mentioned doing, is a good step. Additionally, ensure that your internet connection remains stable during login attempts.
        Previous Quiz Logout Issue:
        The sudden logout during your quiz could indicate a session timeout or a network interruption. Canvas may log users out if there is inactivity or if the system detects a security issue.
        Steps to Resolve:
        Ensure your internet connection is stable and secure.
        Use an updated version of a supported browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
        Clear your browser cache and cookies again before trying to log in.
        If the issue persists, try accessing Canvas from a different device or network to rule out local device/network problems.
        Contact your professor directly regarding the assignment submission issue and provide evidence (e.g., screenshots) showing that you attempted to submit it on time.</br>

        <p> Question: Is there a way to prevent the TA role in Canvas from accessing Item Banks and Quizzes, or do I need to remove the TA from the course entirely?</p>
        <br>Answer: Yes, you can prevent the TA role from accessing Item Banks and Quizzes in Canvas by temporarily changing their role to "Student" while preparing your Quiz. Here’s how you can do it:
        Open your course in Canvas.
        Go to "People" on the left-side menu.
        Search for the TA in the list.
        Click on the three dots next to their name on the right side.
        Select "Edit Role" from the dropdown menu.
        Change their role to "Student."
        Once you have finished preparing your Quiz, you can follow the same steps to change their role back to "TA."</br>

        <p> Question: Why couldn't I load the DEI modules in Canvas, and how was the issue resolved? </p>
        <br>Answer: The issue occurred because of a technical problem with the course. Initially, I reported that I couldn't load the DEI modules in Canvas despite being able to log in and having a working internet connection. The modules would remain stuck loading.
        After reporting the issue, I was asked to provide a screenshot of the problem and confirm my Illinois Tech email address for further investigation. Upon review, it was determined that there was a technical issue with the course, which was then resolved. However, when I tried accessing the modules again, the problem persisted.
        Eventually, I discovered that switching from Firefox to Chrome resolved the issue. Chrome is more compatible with certain features of Canvas, which allowed me to successfully access the DEI modules. If similar issues arise, using Chrome is recommended for better compatibility.</br>
